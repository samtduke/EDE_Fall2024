## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}






```


```{r}



Greenville_Seasonal <- Greenville_Processed %>%
  mutate(Season = case_when(
    (month >= 6 & month <= 11) ~ "Hurricane Season",  # June to November
    TRUE ~ "Frontal"  # December to May
  ))

# 2. Filter data for the years 1980-2016
Greenville_Seasonal <- Greenville_Seasonal %>%
  filter(year >= 1980 & year <= 2016)

# 3. Group by year and season, and calculate the average precipitation for each year and season
Greenville_Seasonal_Averages <- Greenville_Seasonal %>%
  group_by(year, Season) %>%
  summarize(avg_precip = mean(Precipitation_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

# 4. Plot the results using a bar plot with separate linear regression lines for each season

  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +  # Bar plot for both seasons side-by-side

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
